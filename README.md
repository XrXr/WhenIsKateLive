#When is Kate Live?

###The web page is live [here][live page] thanks to Github pages!

This is a web page that contains the following
 - Count down until the next [Kate Live]
 - Schedule of [Kate Live] in the browser's local time

This is inspired by [whenisnlss.com](http://whenisnlss.com/) and made at the request of this [Reddit post]

##Libraries used
 - BootStrap css (through cdn)
 - Moment.js (served with project)

##Building
On the [live page] minified version of libraries are used. The scripts belonging to this project uses [Closure Compiler]
for minification.

##Testing
Tests are written with mocha and Chai

##License
[MIT](LICENSE.txt) for non-vender code.
If you use part(s) of the project somehow, let me know! (You don't have to)

##Browser support
Haphazardly tested on Firefox 30 and Google Chrome 35. Mostly functional on IE 11.
There are no plans to support any version of IE
