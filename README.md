#When is Kate Live?

The web page is live [here][live page] thanks to Github pages!

This is a web page that contains the following
 - Schedule of [Kate Live] in PST and UTC
 - Count down until the next [Kate Live]
 - Time of the next [Kate Live] in the browser's local time

This is inspired by [whenisnlss.com](http://whenisnlss.com/) and made at the request of this [Reddit post]

##Building
On the [live page] minified version of libraries are used. The scripts belonging to this project uses [Closure Compiler]
for minification.
